              <!-- "But I must explain to you how all this mistake idea of denoucing pleasure and praising pain was born
              and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
              explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislike,or avoids
              pleasurer itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
              eationally encounter consequence that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or avoids 
              pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
              occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us 
              ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any 
              right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one 
              who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?" -->
